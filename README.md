# python-52-weeks

This code is intended for demonstration and teaching purposes, and changes regularly as new functionality is added, old is removed, improvements are made, etc. Feel free to learn from it, as that is its purpose, or to ask questions about it, suggest improvements, etc., but don't expect it to be supported, maintained, improved, etc., except as is deemed necessary and expedient by the author. 

Thanks.
